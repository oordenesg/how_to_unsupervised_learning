# how_to_unsupervised_learning

In this repository we will check two commonly used unsupervised learning algorithms:
* Principal Component Analysis
* K-Means

In this exercise we will use the two to perform clustering for Iris Data set.

## Iris Dataset

[Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) is a very popular dataset in machine learning community. Developed by Fisher, it containd 3 classes each with 50 instances. Each of the three class refers to a type of Iris plant. Each data point consists of four different attributes and a class label:

1. sepal length in cm
2. sepal width in cm
3. petal length in cm
4. petal width in cm
5. class:
 * Iris Setosa
 * Iris Versicolour
 * Iris Virginica
